Xilinx ISE Makefile
===================

Tired of clicking around in Xilinx ISE? Run your builds from the command line!


Requirements
------------

  * Xilinx ISE, ideally 14.7 (the final version)

  * GNU (or compatible?) Make

    Install this through Cygwin on Windows.


Creating a project
------------------

To start building a project, you will need to create a file `project.cfg` in
the top level of your project. This file is a text file sourced by Make, so
it consists of `KEY = value` pairs. It must define at least the following keys:

  * `PROJECT`

    The name of the project, used as a name for certain intermediate files, and
    as the default name for the top-level module and constraints file.

  * `TARGET_PART`

    The full part-speed-package identifier for the Xilinx part to be targeted,
    e.g. `xc6slx9-2-tqg144`.

  * `XILINX`

    The path to the appropriate binaries directory of the target Xilinx ISE
    install, e.g.
    `/cygdrive/c/Xilinx/14.7/ISE_DS/ISE`
    or
    `/opt/Xilinx/14.7/ISE_DS/ISE`
    for typical installs.

  * `VSOURCE` and/or `VHDSOURCE`

    The space-separated names of all Verilog and/or VHDL source files to be
    used in the project.

    You can define these on multiple lines using `+=`, e.g.

        VSOURCE += foo.v
        VSOURCE += bar.v

A simple `project.cfg` may thus resemble:

    PROJECT = example
    TARGET_PART = xc6slx9-2-cpg196

    XILINX = /cygdrive/c/Xilinx/14.7/ISE_DS/ISE/bin/nt64

    VSOURCE = example.v

A number of other keys can be set in the project configuration, including:

  * `XILINX_PLATFORM`

    The Xilinx name for the platform to build for, e.g. `nt64` or `lin`.
    `nt64` is used by default for Windows systems, and `lin64` for Linux
    systems, so you only need to set this if you explicitly need to use the
    32-bit version of the tools for some reason.

  * `TOPLEVEL`

    The name of the top-level module to be used in the project.
    (Defaults to `$PROJECT`.)

  * `CONSTRAINTS`

    The name of the constraints file (`.ucf`) to be used for the project.
    (Defaults to `$PROJECT.ucf`.)

  * `COMMON_OPTS`

    Extra command-line options to be passed to all ISE executables. Defaults to
    `-intstyle xflow`.

  * `XST_OPTS`, `NGDBUILD_OPTS`, `MAP_OPTS`, `PAR_OPTS`, `BITGEN_OPTS`,
    `TRACE_OPTS`, `FUSE_OPTS`

    Extra command-line options to be passed to the corresponding ISE tools. All
    default to empty.

    Note that `XST_OPTS` will not appear on the command line during
    compilation, as the XST options are embedded in a script file.

    `MAP_OPTS` and `PAR_OPTS` can be set to `-mt 2` to use multithreading,
    which may speed up compilation of large designs.

    `BITGEN_OPTS` can be set to `-g Compress` to apply bitstream compression.

  * `PROGRAMMER`

    The name of the programmer to be used for `make prog`. Currently supported
    values are:

      * `impact`

        Uses Xilinx iMPACT for programming, using a batch file named
        `impact.cmd` by default. The iMPACT command line may be overridden by
        setting `IMPACT_OPTS`.

        A typical batch file may resemble:

            setMode -bscan
            setCable -p auto
            addDevice -p 1 -file build/projectname.bit
            program -p 1
            quit

      * `digilent`

        Uses the Digilent JTAG utility for programming, which must be installed
        separately. The name of the board must be set as `DJTG_DEVICE`; the
        path to the djtgcfg executable can be set as `DJTG_EXE`, and the index
        of the device can be set as `DJTG_INDEX`.

      * `xc3sprog`

        Uses the xc3sprog utility for programming, which must also be installed
        separately. The cable name must be set as `XC3SPROG_CABLE`; additional
        options can be set as `XC3SPROG_OPTS`.


Targets
-------

The Xilinx ISE Makefile implements the following targets:

  * `make default` (or just `make`)

    Builds the bitstream.

  * `make test`

    Runs any testbenches.

  * `make clean`

    Removes the build directory.

  * `make prog`

    Writes the bitstream to a target device. Requires some additional
    configuration; see below for details.


Running unit tests
------------------

Test `test` target will build and run any testbenches that have been created.

A testbench is any file with a file finishing in `_tb` (overridden by `TEST_POSTFIX`).


Caviates
--------

 * Module names need to match the filename they are within.

 * Module names cannot start with a number.


Unimplemented features
----------------------

The following features are not currently implemented. (Pull requests are
encouraged!)

  * Generation of SPI or other unusual programming files

  * CPLD synthesis

  * Synthesis tools other than XST

  * Display and/or handling of warnings and errors from `build/_xmsgs`

  * Anything else (open an issue?)
